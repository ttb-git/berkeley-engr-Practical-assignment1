datasceince project - will the customer accept a coupon

Problem Statement
Predicting whether the user will accept the coupon or not is a hard problem and we cannot just recommend it to everyone because of the costs involved.
So some local businesses want us to build a system which will accurately predict whether the user will accept their discount coupon or not while keeping the marketing costs as low as possible.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.
Data
This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver. Answers that the user will drive there ‘right away’ or ‘later before the coupon expires’ are labeled as ‘Y = 1’ and answers ‘no, I do not want the coupon’ are labeled as ‘Y = 0’. There are five different types of coupons -- less expensive restaurants (under \$20), coffee houses, carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants (\$20 - \$50).
Deliverables
Your final product should be a brief report that highlights the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons. To explore the data you will utilize your knowledge of plotting, statistical summaries, and visualization using Python. You will publish your findings in a public facing github repository as your first portfolio piece.
